# ceeloDiceGame
A simple Cee-lo Dice game done as a project in Python programming language. 

Here is a small briefing about the game;

Cee-lo â€“ First a random sequence of three dice are rolled. Then each player rolls three dice, trying to match the random sequence. They may choose how many of their dice they want to reroll, to try to better their match. Points are scored for how many dice match the sequence.
