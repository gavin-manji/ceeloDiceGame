""" This is Cee-lo Dice Game.
    Prompt to Enter the number of players going to play the game and maximum number of players should be 4.
    There are 3 dices used in this game.
    Each Player can select the number of rounds to re-roll the dice, after the first roll of dice. 
    Scores are added like this --> 10 points for each dice you match with the random draw of dice by the CPU 
    So, if you match all three dices with the three dices of the Computer randomly drawn,
    then you will get total of 30 points
    NOTE: If 2 or more players get the same score first player who receives the highest score
    is declared ast the highest of them. (Therefore, there will always be a winner)"""
